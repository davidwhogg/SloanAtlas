# notes on 10/20 NSA galaxies that are larger than 30 arcsec radius in the public_html/Large_NSA_galaxies
#see Large_NSA_galaxies2.txt for the rest of the notes

18274 double galaxies, the one that is being fitted has a decent output, should try to initialize as two separate galaxies
33475 nice galaxy with a terrible fit because the large star next to masks out a part of the galaxy leading to bad results
41085 Owl Nebula :)
44968 two galaxies that should be initialized separately
47928 good fit, there is another galaxy that is being picked up, but this looks nice
51913 irregular galaxy with a good fit
86994 two galaxies, good fit on the one being measured...possibly try to initialize on both
90975 could be a good fit for this irregular galaxy but the green(not sure if Dev or exp) becomes too elliptical
96713 group of galaxies that are too small individually and were measured as one larger galaxy.too small to be initialized individually
110390 could be a really nice fit, but the green(exp or dev?) never expands beyong the nucleus
