# notes on 20 NSA galaxies that are larger than 30 arcsec radius in the public_html/Large_NSA_galaxies

18274 double galaxies, the one that is being fitted has a decent output, should try to initialize as two separate galaxies
33475 nice galaxy with a terrible fit because the large star next to masks out a part of the galaxy leading to bad results
41085 Owl Nebula :)
44968 two galaxies that should be initialized separately
47928 good fit, there is another galaxy that is being picked up, but this looks nice
51913 irregular galaxy with a good fit
86994 two galaxies, good fit on the one being measured...possibly try to initialize on both
90975 could be a good fit for this irregular galaxy but the green(not sure if Dev or exp) becomes too elliptical
96713 group of galaxies that are too small individually and were measured as one larger galaxy.too small to be initialized individually
110390 could be a really nice fit, but the green(exp or dev?) never expands beyong the nucleus 
131288 small galaxy, expands too much due to background
133224 good model, not sure how this is not in RC3
133245 galaxy near star got completely masked out, result is junk!
134400 cant tell if the big galaxy would already be in the catalog or if that's the target
136258 faint double galaxies i think
142373 i think this is supposed to model a small galaxy next to a big one, but ends up modeling the big one. Big one is probably in RC3?
144510 way too big, galaxy itself is too small for catalog
148151 Looks like a good fit!
148473 Extemds too far, probably due to lots of stars in background
157610 Very, very faint, hard to tell quality of fit

as of 6/10/13 (while looking for reruns)
NSA_ID_44968 group of galaxies, but this center one is too small, throw it out? it's being measured as 3 in 1
NSA_ID_128520 is a HUGE star that is saturated in the image
