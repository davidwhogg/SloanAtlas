# notes on galaxies that are problematic
MCG_-1-57-18 center of this fit is not accuraete, needs to move upwards
UGC_11861 initializes at a bad place and never found a center, possibily needs a few more iterations
PGC_70104 superimposed star is throwing this off
A_0002-07 the total magnitude in the i band is given as infinity from the updated pickle file because there is no galaxy being fitted, just sky field
NGC_4148 good results but having an error with the getName function that is preventing it from being added to the fits file
NGC_406 good results but having an error with the getName function that is preventing it from being added to the fits file
NGC_988 large, bright star in front of the galaxy blocks most of it
IC_1870 Bright star blocking most of the galaxy
PGC_70104 Bad sky level in i band?
NGC_3365 bad fit, not sure why
NGC_221 famous galaxy, very bad fit
UGCA_295 Bad sky level in i band?
UGC_7332 crazy morphology, fit not great
UGC_9394 very bad fit
LEO_A low surface brightness, but good fit
NGC_52 initializes and fits the bright star next to it
NGC_5194 bad fit, lies off of the color-color plot (M51a)
UGC_7697 not sure what is happening here, inf i flux but a galaxy is not being fit here probably because the galaxy is off-center
A_1402+09 inf i flux, off center galaxy, measures a patch of the sky instead
NGC_5919 inf i flux because this was a group of galaxies which are individually too small to fit, should not be included
A_1153+31 inf i flux because a galaxy is not being measured in these images
UGC_8304 inf i flux, galaxy is off center and the fit is not initializing on the galaxy, but random patch of the sky
NGC_3733 inf i flux, in  masking the huge bright star next to this galaxy, the galaxy becomes masked as well
UGC_3165 inf i flux, fit is not intiliazing on the galaxy in the images
A_114752 inf i flux, the fit does not initialize on a galaxy (off center)
A_2302+16 inf i flux, the fit does not initialize on a galaxy (off center)
UGC_10050 inf i flux, bad image for this galaxy, bright star and off center...bad candidate to include



as of 6/10/13(while look for reruns)
NGC_3227 its partner 3226 is out of the image
NGC_988 star is obstructing the galaxy
UGC 10245 is out of the field of the image...so its not measuring anything, what to do?
UGC_3437 i dont see a galaxy here

check flipbooks first:
NGC_3691 fb?
UGC_10961 fb?
A_1646+62 fb?
A+1402+09 fb?
A_114752  fb?
A_2302+16 fb?
