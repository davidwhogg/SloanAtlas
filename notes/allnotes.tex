NSA ID 41085 & Owl Nebula :)\\ \hline
NSA ID 44968 & little galaxy between two galaxies; bad fit (cq)\\ \hline
NSA ID 47928 & good fit, there is another galaxy that is being picked up, but this looks nice\\ \hline

NSA ID 96713 & group of galaxies that are too small individually and were measured as one larger galaxy.too small to be initialized individually\\ \hline
NSA ID 110390 & could be a really nice fit, but the green(exp or dev?) never expands beyond the nucleus\\ \hline

NSA ID 136258 & faint double galaxies i think\\ \hline
NSA ID 142373 & i think this is supposed to model a small galaxy next to a big one, but ends up modeling the big one. Big one is probably in RC3?\\ \hline

NSA ID 148151 & Looks like a good fit!\\ \hline
