\begin{abstract}
The measurement of galaxies with large angular sizes is challenging,
and has rarely been done well in automated settings.  Issues include
that the galaxies overlap field boundaries, overlap foreground stars,
and show detailed and confusing internal structure at high
signal-to-noise.  We take a generative modeling or likelihood approach
to making measurements of the galaxies, but with the likelihood
modified for robustness.  We show that we get reliable measurements
for very large galaxies ($>1~\arcmin$ in diameter) in the
\project{Sloan Digital Sky Survey} imaging data.

\section{Introduction}

\section{Data and input catalogs}
The primary source of for the input catalog was the Third Reference Catalog of Bright Galaxies (RC3) from which we pulled all objects which had an angular diameter equal to or greater than 2 arcminutes. Next, we checked the NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) for any objects of significant size that were also not in RC3. The cut was for objects with a 50\% light radius of the SERSIC fit greater than 30 arcseconds. The objects were then examined by eye to determine which ones were actual large galaxies, and which were errors in the NSA. We also checked the 2MASS Large Galaxy Atlas but no galaxies of the correct size not already in RC3 were found. The cut for 2MASS was based on the isophotal fiduciary radius in the K-band, which was checked to a radius of 1 arcminute.

\section{Method}

Saturated pixels from the SDSS images were masked and then a binary dilation with three iterations was applied (using the SciPy function) more details needed here?

For the purpose of measuring and optimizing on a single galaxy at a
time, all other objects were removed from within a circle centered on
the galaxy center and radius, both given by the RC3 catalog (which
radius?) for that particular catalog. This was done rather than
working within the SDSS catalog because SDSS frequently split up large
galaxies into numerous small ones and so it was much easier to simply
start over with a single galaxy. As initialization, that galaxy was
given magnitudes of 15 in every band and a radius given by the RC3
catalog.

In order to deal with the problems of stars that overlap with the
galaxy which we are interested in, we decided to mask them out. The
stars were found using the data in the TYCHO2 star catalog Add tycho2 cite
 using the spherematch function of astrometry.net. The stars were masked out to a
radius of
\begin{equation}
\theta_{\mathrm{exclude}} = \max(25, 25\,2^{[11\,\mag-V]})
\end{equation}
where $V$ is the visual magnitude given by TYCHO2.
(I'm not sure why these values, I got them from Dustin)

The iteratively-reweighted least squares process is used to update the
inverse variances after each iteration of optimization. The formula
used is: \begin{equation} \frac{1}{\sigma}=\frac{Q^2}{Q^2+\chi^2}
\end{equation}
where $Q$ is the number of ``sigma'' at which the residual saturates. $Q$ for these fittings was chosen to be 5. (Find out why)


We start the fitting with an exponential galaxy and then optimize
simply that galaxy six times. Following that, we switch to a composite
galaxy, with both exponential and deVaucouleur components. These
components are free to vary separately in order to best fit the
data. This new composite galaxy is also optimized six times by itself.

In order to measure the half-light radius $\rfifty$, the 90 percent
radius $\rninety$ and the concentration parameter $\conc\equiv
\rninety/\rfifty$, we took the model of the galaxy that had been
optimized and places it in an empty frame within the tractor. Next,
over a series of increasing intervals of radii we summed up the total
flux within the circles and then interpolated to find $\rfifty$ and $\rninety$.
Exceptional cases were flagged for later review if $\rfifty$ was not between the deVaucouleur and exponential radii for that galaxy, and concentration was flagged as incorrect if $\frac{1}{\conc}$ was not between .29 and .46. TODO: Add citation to paper for these numbers

For instance, the galaxy M81 had too large of a radius in RC3 in order to run properly so it was manually reduced so as to fit into the memory of the machine. Another example is M51a and M51b, which were simultaneously fit in order to ensure that the fit measured both galaxies simultaneously. 

All data that was flagged for review was reviewed by examination of the flipbook for that galaxy, in order that changes could be made to the initialization for that galaxy, or if the expected galaxy was nonexistent and therefore a mistake in a prior catalog, removed entirely from the catalog.
