\newline \tiny Figure 1. The color distribution of a selected set of Nasa-Sloan Atlas galaxies is provided in the background of this plot. 'Good' data has been identified with black points, while 'bad' data is given in magenta. The criteria for bad data include galaxies with negative fluxes in the \textit{i} and \textit{g} bands as well as any galaxy with a half-light radius of 158 arcsec or greater.This distribution has also been corrected for extinction. Each pair of connected stars represents the original and SFD dust map corrected colors for Messier galaxies that have been fitted with \textit{Tractor}.}

\newline \tiny Figure 2. The background color distribution is the same set of Nasa-Sloan Atlas galaxies with identical parameters as those described in Figure 1. In the left panel, each star represents the colors of a Messier galaxy fitted by \textit{Tractor}. The colors here are calculated from the combined Exp and deV magnitudes. In the right panel, the \textit{Tractor} colors for each galaxy are plotted again, but the magnitudes have been corrected for extinction with the SFD Dust maps before colors were calculated.}

\newline \tiny Figure 3. In addition to the Nasa-Sloan color distribution, this plot provides three different colors for each Messier galaxy fitted by \textit{Tractor}. The triangles show the color resulting from the non-extinction corrected color calculated from the Exp magnitudes. The square gives the colors resulting from the non-extinction corrected deV magnitudes. The star gives the non-extinction corrected color resulting from the combined magnitudes. }

\newline \tiny Figure 4. The \textit{Tractor} output and symbols remain the same as described above in Figure 3, but this plot shows the distribution of all non-extinction corrected colors of the Messier galaxies.}
