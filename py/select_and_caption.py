to-do:

- Make plots of the input catalog (currently the NASA-Sloan Atlas) to
  guide selection.

- Design boxels in top-level space (color and central surface
  brightness?).

- Within each boxel, select galaxies in decreasing order in angular
  size.

- For each galaxy selected, produce "caption information" including
  plots of location in property space (say, radial profile and
  something?), RC3 classification, and GalaxyZoo information.

- Build plates from galaxies based on angular size and build joint
  captions for plates.
