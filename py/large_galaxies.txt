# notes on galaxies that are problematic
MCG-1-57-18: center of this fit is not accuraete, needs to move upwards
UGC 11861: initializes at a bad place and never found a center, possibily needs a few more iterations
PGC 70104: superimposed star is throwing this off
A_0002-07: the total magnitude in the i band is given as infinity from the updated pickle file...
NGC 4148: good results but having an error with the getName function that is preventing it from being added to the fits file
NGC 4066: see NGC 4148
